# ♦️Python BlackJack
A fully interactive **Blackjack (21)** game built using **Python** and **Pygame**, featuring a graphical user interface, real-time game logic, and standard casino rules. This project demonstrates event-driven programming, game-state management, and clean Python architecture.
## 💻 Technologies
- **Python 3.13.9**
- **Pygame**
## 🎮 Features
- Classic Blackjack gameplay (Player vs Dealer)
- Graphical User Interface built with **Pygame**
- Multiple decks to prevent card counting
- Player actions: **Hit** or **Stand**
- Automated dealer logic (hits until 17)
- Win / Loss / Draw tracking
- Restart and replay functionality
- Real-time score calculation and bust detection
## 🧠 The Process
- Implemented core Blackjack logic separately from the UI to ensure clear, deterministic game behavior  
- Integrated Pygame’s event loop for real-time input handling, rendering, and state transitions  
- Tested key edge cases and refactored the code to maintain clarity and extensibility
## 🚦 Running the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you are using a Python version supported by **Pygame** (Python 3.13.9 recommended)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install pygame`
4. Run the game: `python blackJack.py`
